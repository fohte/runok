## New Features

### `fs.home` and `fs.cwd` in `when` clauses ([#451](https://github.com/fohte/runok/pull/451))

The `fs` namespace now exposes `fs.home` and `fs.cwd` as values, alongside the existing `fs.exists()` / `fs.is_file()` / `fs.is_dir()` functions. `fs.cwd` is read directly from the OS, so unlike `env.PWD` it cannot go stale or be left unset by a shell that does not export `PWD`. `fs.home` is `null` when the home directory cannot be determined, rather than folding that into an empty-string prefix that would silently match everything.

```yaml
rules:
  # Allow `make` only under a chosen directory tree in the user's home.
  - allow: 'make *'
    when: "fs.cwd.startsWith(fs.home + '/projects/')"
```

See [When Clauses -> Filesystem](/rule-evaluation/when-clause/#filesystem) for details.
